# rayFIRST

This is a FTC and (soon) FRC extension for raycast. It uses data from FTCScout and (soon) The Blue Alliance.

# Quick start

Once I finish the FRC implementation I'll publish it on the raycast appstore. Until then, you can use download it and follow the instructions.

Install the require dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

Run the extension in development mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

Right now only FTC team search works, although you can see all of a team's matches sorted by event. You can close the development command once it shows up in raycast, and it'll persist.
